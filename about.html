        <h2>Present Situation</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Women are subjected to various forms of violence such as eve-teasing, sexual harassment, domestic violence, marital rape, cyber harassment, psychological harassment, discrimination, human trafficking, genital mutiliation, sexism, honour killings etc.
          </li>
          <li>
            Reporting of crimes against women is on the rise year by year. Rapid growth of technology and rising modernization could not help in improving the situation.
          </li>
          <li>
            The age-old discrimination against women has deep roots in the various religious norms, cultures and especially our patriarchial society.
          </li>
          <li>
            A young girl going to the school, a teenage girl partying late nights, a student wearing short skirts, a stay at home mother are all equally vulnerable to harassment and molestation.
          </li>
        </ul><br>
        <h2>Steps taken by Indian Government</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            To curb the crimes against women, Indian government deployed PCR vans with GPS system to ensure the security of women in Delhi NCR region.
          </li>
          <li>
            Telangana government introduced “SHE Teams” to tackle crimes on women. This program is a huge success inspiring all the other Indian states.
          </li>
          <li>
            'Ministry of Home Affairs' allotted the number "112" for Nationwide Emergency Response System.
          </li>
          <li>
            To protect child brides and to eradicate child marriages, Government forbids marital sex with the bride under 18 years of age and would be considered rape if not followed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Prenatal sex discernment is banned, preventing determination of sex of the child before birth and lowering the rate of female infanticide in India.
          </li>
          <li>
            Media is not allowed to reveal the victim's name and details, thus encouraging the harassment victims to report the crime.
          </li>
          <li>
            "Domestic violence act" enforced on 26th of October (2006), hinders the male dominance over their wives.
          </li>
          <li>
            IPC Section 498-A obstructs the husband and relatives subjecting women to any sort of criminal act and makes women feel respected at their homes.
          </li>
        </ul><br>
        <h2>What still needs to be done </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            More patrolling vans should be deployed to ensure the safety of women.
          </li>
          <li>
            Movies that show eve-teasing and harassment as love should be censored.
          </li>
          <li>
            Gender sensitization programs should be conducted on a regular basis at schools and collges.
          </li>
          <li>
            Uneducated Indian politicians pollute the entire reputation of government officials. A social media hashtag #AintNoCinderella received popularity among teenagers mocking politicians who feel women must not roam on the streets after 12 AM. Politicans who are against gender equality should be stripped of power.
          </li>
          <li>
            Rapid misuse of Dowry harassment law forced Supreme Court to dilute the law to some extent. This discourages victims in genuine cases to report the harassment. Steps should be taken to deter false cases, thereby genuine victims can be rescued.
          </li>
          <li>
            Andhra Pradesh is the state ranking first with a maximum number of cases reported every year addressing gender discrimination and crime against women along with Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal. Special care must be taken in these states to reduce the crimes.
          </li>
        </ul><br>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        To transform India into a developed country, gender equality and crimes against women are the most important things to be focused on. Legends like Malala Yousafzai have repeatedly inspired women all over the globe and left an inevitable imprint on the human race. The country now demands a dire need for the upliftment of the basic mentality of looking at women differently.
